This directory contains the following files:

- allheaders.h.gch which is a pre-compiled header file.
- libsclpshared.so which is a shared object file.
- sclp which is the reference implementation.
- reg-alloc.cc for regsiter allocation scheme
- Makefile which contains the commands to build your implementation.
- Besides, the following header files are provided ONLY for telling you the
  class structure and the member functions whose implementation is provided
  in the library. YOU DO NOT NEED TO INCLUDE ANY OF THESE FILES IN YOUR IMPLEMENTATION.
  . storetokens.hh contains the declaration of the function which you can call to 
    store tokens and print them.
  . ast.hh
  . procedure.hh
  . program.hh
  . symbol-table.hh
  . local-environment.hh
  . reg-alloc.hh
  . icode.hh
You need to write 
   - a scanner, 
   - a parser, 
   - actions within the scanner and parser to construct Abstract Syntax Trees, 
   - ast functions, and
   - an interperter 
   - a compiler which generates spim code for the input program. 

   You need to understand the local environment used for evaluation.

   A high level description of the classes can be found on the sclp web page 
   https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/web-source/.
   You need to create the top level object for program. 

You need to add code to handle new constructs which include function declarations and definitions, and function calls and returns.

For ease of working on small programs, you can use the -d option to produce the dump on the screen 
instead of having to open the dump files.

For the AST you need to create objects of the following classes:

	- Assignment_Ast, 
	- Name_Ast, 
	- Number_Ast, 
	- Arithmetic_Expr_Ast (and its derived classes)
	- Selection_Statement_Ast
	- Relational_Expr_Ast
	- Logical_Expr_Ast
	- COnditional_Op_Ast
	- Iterative_Statement_Ast
        - Sequence_Statement_Ast
        - Print_Ast
        - Call_Ast
        - Return_ASt

You will need to submit ONLY the scanner.l, parser.y, ast.cc, local-environment.cc, ast-eval.cc, ast-compile.cc, and icode.cc files.
